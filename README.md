The aim of this project is to predict the treatment response of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) patienjt with machine learning (ML) methods by using 3D CT scans. 

In the first part, an unsupervised ML method was implemented on the features extracted
from CTs using radiomics. The result was compared with labels created by looking at the
volume change on the follow-up CT scans.

In the second part, supervised ML methods, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based deep neural network models were employed.
